## Key Features of FXP

### 1. Trade to Mint Technology

The core feature of FXP is its **Trade to Mint** design:

- **Only way to mint FXP**: A mint is unlocked only after a full trade is completed on Flur or via the Flur smart contract.
- **Open order book trades**: The trade must be a fully executed order (no partial orders).
- **Claimable Mint**: Once a trade is complete, a mint is available for the order maker to claim. Only the order maker can claim the mint.
### 2. Mint Reward Distribution

- Upon the completion of a trade, the order maker is rewarded with a claim that can be redeemed for FXP.
  
### 3. Randomized Minting System

The number of tokens released per mint is randomly determined by the blockchain’s output hash, and can vary widely:

- **Random Mint Reward**: Each mint releases a random number of FXP, anywhere from **1 to 128 tokens**.
- **Jackpot Mint Reward**: There is a special jackpot mint of **420 tokens** if the output hash hits **number 69** during the minting process.

### 4. Full Orders Only

- **No rewards for partial fills**: Only full buy or sell orders trigger a mint. If an order is partially filled, no mint will be unlocked until the entire order is completed.
