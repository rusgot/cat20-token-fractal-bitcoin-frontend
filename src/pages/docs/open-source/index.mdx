# Open Source

The source code for flur is 100% open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-fractal). This commitment to open source development provides multiple benefits for our community:

## Transparency & Collaboration

- **Full Code Transparency**: Anyone can inspect, audit, and verify the platform's functionality
- **Community Contributions**: Developers can directly contribute improvements and new features
- **Security Auditing**: The open codebase allows for community-driven security reviews
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation and discussions help educate developers about the platform
- **Creative Freedom**: Open source enables experimentation with fringe and creative ideas that might not fit traditional development paths

## Self-Hosting Options

Users have the freedom to run their own instance of flur, which is particularly valuable in scenarios such as:

- High traffic periods when main servers are under heavy load
- Custom deployment needs requiring specific modifications
- Organizations wanting full control over their data and infrastructure
- Development and testing environments

## Getting Started

Flur consists of two main components:

1. [Frontend](/docs/open-source/frontend) - A Next.js application that provides the user interface
2. [Backend](/docs/open-source/backend) - The tracker API for managing CAT Protocol assets

Choose your area of interest:
- For UI development, visit our [Frontend Guide](/docs/open-source/frontend)
- For API and infrastructure, check out our [Backend Guide](/docs/open-source/backend)

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes and feature improvements to documentation updates and translations.
